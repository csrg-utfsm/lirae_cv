Master bibliography databases for CSRG (and possibly others...)

The files here collect the (hopefully complete, checked and correct)
references used in the papers of the CSRG projects.

To extract the exact entries used in a particular paper (so you can ship the
source with the complete bibliography, but without extraneous entries), do:

  $ pdflatex paper                     # Generate the paper.aux file
                                       # using the full \bibliography{...}
  $ bibtool -x paper.aux -o paper.bib  # Extract only the entries used here
                                       # into paper.bib

You will have to fix the \bibliography{...} to now use paper.bib.

Please make an effort to get a complete entry, including full names of the
authors, pages of the articles, numbers and volumes of journals, etc. The
entry schema offered by AUC-TeX (xemacs or emacs) is a good guide of what
you should look for. Please make sure to fill in the right fields. Also, if
you find it, include the DOI reference.

Also please don't use UTF8 (or other non-ASCII) codings here, the entries
will also be used in documents written in pure ASCII. Likewise, don't use
non-standard LaTeX commands, as you can't assume any particular packages are
loaded.
